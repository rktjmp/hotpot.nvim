# üç≤ Hotpot Changelog

Breaking changes are in **bold**. Note that the SEMVER MAJOR version is 0, so
breaking changes may occur on minor point releases. Generally breaking changes
to "core" code (things that effect loading and running your code/config) are
avoided but breaking changes to the API (things that might effect your bindings
and auto commands) are treated with less reverence.

## 0.14.9

- Disable fennel parser warnings, which are printed to stderr.

## 0.14.8

- Updated to Fennel 1.5.3, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.14.7

- Fix `:checkhealth hotpot` disk usage report attempting to `size + nil`.

## 0.14.6

- Improve `:checkhealth hotpot` module seacher report when luarocks is present.

## 0.14.5

- Fix diagnostics.disable trying to detach from nil buffer.

## 0.14.4

  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.14.2

- Fix support for dashes in runtime plugin paths, eg: `plugin/my-plugin.fnl`.

## 0.14.1

- Disable Fennel's stderr output (temporarily) when it encounters compiler warnings.

## 0.14.0

- **Remove `provide_require_fennel` option**, support for `require("fennel")`
  is now always provided.
- **Always enable diagnostics**. Previously was enabled by default, but only if
  you called `setup()`, now enabled by `require("hotpot")`.
- Add `./fnl` paths to `fennel.path` and `fennel.macro-path` when compiling.

## 0.13.1

- Improve Rocks.nvim compatibility.

## 0.13.0

- Updated to Fennel 1.5.0, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.12.1

- Fix nvim 0.10.0 health report deprecation warnings.

## 0.12.0

- **`vim.loader.enable()` must be called before requiring hotpot *if you are using `vim.loader`*.**
- Added `:checkhealth hotpot`.
- Added `{silent=true}` option to `api.cache.clear-cache`
- **Changed `api.cache.open-cache` to accept a callback which should accept the
  cache path as its first argument. If no callback is given, the cache path is
  opened in a `vsplit`.**

## 0.11.1

- Updated to Fennel 1.4.2, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.11.0

- **Updated to Fennel 1.4.1**, may contain unintended breaking changes from

## 0.10.0

- **Updated to Fennel 1.4.0**, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.9.7

- Fix diagnostics message match pattern to include "column -1".
- Fix clean key missing from sigil file whitelist.

## 0.9.6

- Fix detecting mod/init.fnl vs mod-init.fnl.
- Pass modname, modpath to compiler plugins, available under ... as per
  normal lua requires.

## 0.9.5

- Add `api.make.auto.build(path, ?opts)` to manually trigger `.hotpot.lua`
  saving a file.
- Add `colocation = true` deprecation message, recommend `build = true`.

## 0.9.4

- Add support for plugin/* after/* indent/*
- Fix recompilation behaviour with ftplugins.
- Fix `.hotpot.lua` clean failing to run when `atomic = true`

## 0.9.3

- Fix "is a macro" indicator passed to preprocessor.
  - Both keys `macro?` and `macro` are supported, but `macro` is currently the
    documented key as it works in both lua and fennel contexts.

## 0.9.2

- Clear Fennels `macros-loaded` table during `api.make` compile calls to ensure
  macro changes are propagated.

## 0.9.1

- Fix ftplugin first-time loading bug

## 0.9.0

- Add support for `.hotpot.lua` file.
  - Specify per-project compiler options, automate build-on-save, see `:h hotpot-cookbook-using-dot-hotpot`.
- **Previous `api.make.build` interface has been deprecated, see `:h hotpot.api.make` for details.**
  - If you are using an `init.fnl` file, you should check the updated
  instructions in the [COOKBOOK](COOKBOOK.md).
- **`api.make.check` has been deprecated, see `dryrun` option for `api.make.build`.**
- **Most `api.*` function signatures have changed to accept `compile-options` as would be given to `setup()`.**
- **Removed some API cache lookup functions.**
  - Added `open-cache(how, opts)` which opens the cache path in neovims directory explorer.

## 0.8.2

- Better support for ftplugins.

## 0.8.1

- Remove compile accidental logging.

## 0.8.0

- **Writing macros in *lua* is no longer supported**.
- **Required Neovim version bumped to 0.9.**
- Replaced internal bytecode-index loader with `vim.loader` backed loader.
  - Lua files will only be cached by `vim.loader` if you enable caching via
  `vim.loader.enable`!
- Added support for lua colocation, compiling `dir/mod/fnl` into `dir/mod/lua`.
- Native support for `ftplugin/`.

## 0.7.0

- **Updated to Fennel 1.3.1**, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.6.0

- **Updated to Fennel 1.3.0**, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.
- Adjusted "file changed" tracking to use mtime + size for cache invalidation.

## 0.5.3

- Removed viml code from compiler code path so Hotpot has a better chance of
  running outside of neovims main thread. (Doing this requires nvim 0.8+).

## 0.5.2

- Fixed diagnostics inside "macro modules".
- Added `compiler.modules.plugins` and `compiler.macros.plugins` config options
  to support user specified fennel compiler plugins.

## 0.5.1

- Fixed `filename` option persisting between some `api.compile` function calls.
- Added module name guessing to `api.make.build` calls for relative-require
  support.

## 0.5.0

- **Updated to Fennel 1.2.1**, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.4.1

- Added traceback wrapper to strip ANSI escape codes from fennel
  compiler output.

## 0.4.0

- **Updated to Fennel 1.2.0**, may contain unintended breaking changes from
  upstream, see Fennels own changelog.

## 0.3.2

- **Fixed `detach` spelling in `hotpot.api.diagnostics` and `hotpot.api.reflect`**
- Updated `hotpot.api.make.build` and `hotpot.api.make.check` to accept a
  directory or single file as the source argument.
- Fixed passing compiler options to Make API.
- Added experimental optional `how` argument to `hotpot.api.diagnostics.set-options`.

## 0.3.1

- Added 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 compatible diagnostic line detection.
- Fixed diagnostics failing to attach to additional buffers.
- Added `diagnostics.set-options` to allow overriding compiler options for some
  buffers.

## 0.3.0

- **Neovim 0.7 required**
- **Improved `x-selection` API selection accuracy.**
  - Now uses `nvim_get_mode`, sometimes bindings set by `whichkey.nvim`
    incorrectly report the current mode, so this is potentially breaking if you
    use a non-standard way to set keys. Keymaps set via `vim.keymap.set` behave
    correctly.
- **`hotpot.api.eval` functions now return `true result` or `false error` for
symmetry with `hotpot.api.compile`.**
- **Moved `fnl`, `fnlfile`, `fnldo`, `eval-operator` and `eval-operator-bang`
  to `hotpot.api.command`.**
- Added in-editor diagnostics via `hotpot.api.diagnostics`
  - Enabled automatically in Fennel files. See `:h hotpot.api.diagnostics` for
    details and how to disable.
- Added ahead of time compilation via `hotpot.api.make`.
- Added in-editor repl-like via `hotpot.api.reflect`
  - Mark regions of your code and show the results of the compilation or
    evaluation as you edit. See `:h hotpot.api.reflect` for details.
